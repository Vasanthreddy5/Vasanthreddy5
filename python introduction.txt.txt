CHAPTER-1:->Introduction to python
-----Topics:-
    1) What is python?
    2) Features of python


What is programming:-
-snake game
-Programming is just an instructing computer using programming language

Programming languagees:-c,c++,python etc

compiler/interpreter:-
-There is one problem.our computer understands only binary language(machine level language) {binary language is also known as machine level language}
-->But,we don't understand this binary language
-translator(compiler/interpreter)---->binary language(.exe) 

----->IDE is a software where we write our programms.

---What is python----
---->Python is a widely used high-level-programming language created by "Guido-Van-Rossum" in the late 1991.The language places strong emphasis on code readability and simplicity,making it possible for programmers to develop applications rapidly.

#we can say it as (python is simple,high-level,object-oriented,interpreted,general purpose programming language.)

-->python is simple:-
 -learning is easy
 -simple and easy syntax

--->Python is high-level programming language
1)high-level 2)assembly 3) low level
--the syntax/code of python is understandable to us.

--->Python is a high level programming language that is easy to understand and read by humans."so,it is called as high-level programming because it is easy for humans to understand and the coding is also quite easy

--->python is object-oriented programming language

--we can create classes and objects in python.
--python supports polymorphism,abstraction,encapsulation,inheritance etc.
--python considers everything as object

-python is interpreted language:-
---->An interpreter translates code written in a high level programming language into machine code line-by-line as the code runs.(high level to low level)

---what is compiler
---->a compiler translates from a high-level programming language into machine code before the program runs.

--python is general purpose language
---->Data sci,data analytics,AI,Roboticcs,web dev,android application,games,scripting,web scraping etc

-->And it os first appered on 20 February 1991.

-->Python is Dynamically typed and a garbage-collected.it supports multiple programming paradigms,including structured,object-oriented and functional programming.

Features of python:-
  1.python is simple
  2.open source and free
  3.simple learn
  4.python is general purpose
  5.object oriented
  6.portability
  7.platform independent
  8.standard libraries
  9.rich library support
  10.embeddable
  11.python supports multiple programming patterns
   --procedures
   --functional
   --control sequences
   --object oriented
   12.dynamically typed language
   (suppose u want to create variable in c we create int a=12; but in python dynamically assigns datatypes to values. )

---Applications of python
1.web development(django,flask,bottle,pyramid)
2.data science
3.machine larning
4.data analysis
5.data mining
6.AI/robotics
7.android development
8.image processing
9.database access
10.desktop gui applications
11.business applications
12.network programming

-->How Python works

1.write source code.
2.compile code using python compiler
3.compiler converts into bytecode
4.computer doesn't understand bytecode.
5.so,pvm converts bytecode into machine code using interpreter.

python code(Hello.py)-->compiler--->bytecode(hello.pyc)-->PVM(interpreter)-->machinecode(hello.exe)

--->why we need both?
--if we use only compiler,you will have speed but not portability
--if we use only interpreter you will have portability but not speed.
--so,using both is compromise between speed and portability.

---why python
---->python works on different platforms(windows,mac,linux,raspberry pi,etc)
---->python has a simple syntax similar to the english language
--->python has syntax that allows developers to write pgm with fewr lines than some other programming languages.
